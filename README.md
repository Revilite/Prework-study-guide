# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
My motivation to get this work done was the deadline in doing so.
I wanted to build this project because I wanted to  be able to use this website for notes for class
It solves the problem of inexperience with using github and gitbash
I learned how to use github and gitbash to save my code online and updating to the cloud

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

I dont have many features.
## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

On vs code you are able to run and open the html file to view what the website would look like.
